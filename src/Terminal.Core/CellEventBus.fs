/// ADR 0007 D9 / Phase 6a-1 — the canonical, modality-agnostic
/// cell-event stream.
///
/// D9 locks that cell lifecycle / navigation / operation events
/// are first-class **typed** semantic events on one canonical
/// pipeline, with many composable sinks (speech, earcon, future
/// braille, the Phase 6a history list) — speech is not primary
/// with the rest bolted on. This module is that pipeline for the
/// cell layer: a single typed `CellEvent` published to N
/// subscribers. It is the cell-layer instance of ADR 0001's
/// substrate/channel dichotomy + ADR 0004 Decision 4 ("one
/// canonical unambiguous event stream, many sinks"); it runs
/// *parallel to*, not squeezed into, the byte-oriented
/// `OutputDispatcher` (cell events carry typed `CellView`s, not
/// rendered-text `OutputEvent`s — a sink must never re-derive
/// cell meaning from rendered output: ADR 0008).
///
/// Resolution of the ADR 0007 open decision "`pty-speak.cell.*`
/// ActivityId taxonomy / cell pipeline shape (Phase 6a / D9)":
/// the canonical cell pipeline is *this dedicated typed bus*
/// (not an `OutputDispatcher` route). The `pty-speak.cell.*`
/// `ActivityIds` are the per-event routing / NVDA-per-tag-config
/// tags a sink applies when it renders one. Settled here in 6a
/// per the ADR's "settle when 6a wires the first event".
///
/// Scope discipline (walking-skeleton): 6a-1 defines the
/// contract + the bus + wires the lowest-risk real publication
/// (`Focused`, off the existing user-nav handlers — additive,
/// the dogfood-validated direct announce is untouched). The
/// `Appended` seal event (the D8 list's update mechanism) and
/// the WPF list subscriber land in 6a-2, where their audible /
/// AT effect is dogfood-validated together (the D8 control-type
/// ratification gate). Only the case a shipped phase wires is
/// declared.
///
/// The subscriber registry mirrors
/// `OutputDispatcher.installEventTap` exactly (token-keyed map
/// under a lock, `IDisposable` unsubscribe, snapshot-then-fire)
/// so the concurrency reasoning is identical and already
/// battle-tested. `publish` is exception-guarded: a throwing
/// sink (a UI-thread marshal in 6a-2, say) must never break the
/// Manual-navigation path that published the event.
