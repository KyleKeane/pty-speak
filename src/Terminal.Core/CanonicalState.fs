/// Phase A — Layer 2 canonical-state substrate.
///
/// The substrate captures a single Screen snapshot and exposes
/// canonical representations of it that display pathways
/// (Layer 3) consume. v1 ships just Snapshot + RowHashes +
/// computeDiff; future Phase 2 / Phase 3 sub-stages add lazy
/// SemanticSegments + AiInterpretation fields without breaking
/// existing pathway implementations.
///
/// **Design note: stateless substrate, stateful pathways.**
/// The plan-file architectural draft sketched
/// `DiffSince: int64 -> CanonicalDiff` — substrate keeps
/// snapshot history indexed by sequence. Implementation chose
/// the functionally-equivalent inverse: substrate is mostly
/// stateless (current snapshot + current row hashes), pathway
/// stores its own `lastSeenRowHashes`, and the substrate's
/// `computeDiff` is a pure function `previousRowHashes ->
/// CanonicalDiff`. Cheaper memory footprint (no per-sequence
/// snapshot history); the pathway-side state is one uint64[]
/// of length screenRows.
///
/// **Algorithm reuse.** `Coalescer.hashRow` and
/// `Coalescer.hashRowContent` (originally Stage 5 / PR-M
/// infrastructure) provide the per-row hashes that drive
/// change detection. `Coalescer.renderRows`-style per-row
/// rendering produces the text. The substrate calls into
/// these helpers — Phase A doesn't add new algorithms.
