# Changelog

All notable changes to `pty-speak` will be documented here. The format
is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

Release tags follow the pattern `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g. `v0.1.0`),
or `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-preview.N` / `-rc.N` for prereleases.
Releases are produced by **publishing a release** in the GitHub
Releases UI (which creates the tag). The `release: published` event
triggers the Velopack release workflow described in
[`docs/RELEASE-PROCESS.md`](docs/RELEASE-PROCESS.md), which builds the
artifacts and updates the just-published release with the proper
title, body, and Velopack `Setup.exe` + nupkg + `RELEASES` files.

## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- `.github/workflows/diagnose.yml`. Was added during the Stage 0
  release-pipeline diagnostic loop to isolate `release.yml` from
  workflow-level config issues. Its lessons live in the "Common
  pitfalls" section of [`docs/RELEASE-PROCESS.md`](docs/RELEASE-PROCESS.md);
  the workflow itself is no longer needed.

_(Stage 1 work lands here.)_

## [0.0.1-preview.15] — 2026-04-27

First Stage 0 preview to ship installable artifacts. **Unsigned
preview build** — Authenticode + Ed25519 manifest signing are
deferred until before `v0.1.0`; SmartScreen will warn on first run.
See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

This version's binary footprint is intentionally trivial: an empty
WPF window titled "pty-speak" with `AutomationProperties.Name` set so
NVDA announces it. It exists so the deployment pipe is end-to-end
green before any terminal logic lands; future stages add the actual
ConPTY / parser / UIA work on top.

### Added

- Stage 0 shipping skeleton: F# / C# / WPF solution structure under
  [`src/`](src/) and [`tests/`](tests/) with a buildable empty-window
  app, central package management, and `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`
  from day one.
  - F# class libraries `Terminal.Core`, `Terminal.Pty`, `Terminal.Parser`,
    `Terminal.Audio`, `Terminal.Accessibility` (placeholders for
    Stages 1–9).
  - C# WPF library `Views` hosting `MainWindow.xaml` with
    `AutomationProperties` set on the outer window. App is a plain C#
    `Application` subclass (no `App.xaml`); a Stage 0 window has no
    application-level resources.
  - F# EXE `Terminal.App` owning the `[<EntryPoint>][<STAThread>]`
    `main` that invokes `VelopackApp.Build().Run()` before any WPF
    type loads (Velopack issue #195).
  - `Tests.Unit` (xUnit + FsCheck.Xunit smoke tests) and `Tests.Ui`
    (placeholder; FlaUI work begins in Stage 4).
- CI now restores, builds, tests, publishes the app, and runs a
  Velopack `vpk pack` smoke on every PR; the resulting installer is
  uploaded as a `velopack-smoke-<run>` artifact (7-day retention).
- Release workflow keyed on `release: published` events. Maintainer
  publishes a release via the GitHub Releases UI (Target = `main`,
  prerelease checkbox set); workflow then builds, packs with
  Velopack, generates release notes from the matching CHANGELOG
  section, and updates the just-created release with the body and
  installer artifacts via `softprops/action-gh-release@v3`.

### Changed

- Release workflow simplified: SignPath Authenticode submission,
  Ed25519 release-manifest signing, and Authenticode verification
  steps are removed for the unsigned preview line. They will be
  reintroduced before `v0.1.0`; the "Re-enabling signing (deferred)"
  appendix in [`docs/RELEASE-PROCESS.md`](docs/RELEASE-PROCESS.md)
  keeps the procedure on file.
- CI no longer guards Restore/Build/Test on `hashFiles(...) != ''` —
  a typo in a project file now fails CI loudly instead of silently
  no-op'ing.

### Notes

- `v0.0.1-preview.{1..14}` were tagged in succession but never shipped
  installable artifacts; each was a diagnostic step in unwinding a
  silent workflow startup_failure on this repo. Root cause was a
  PowerShell `@"..."@` heredoc whose body lines were at column 0 in
  the YAML source while the surrounding `run: |` block was indented
  ten spaces — YAML literal blocks require all content lines to be
  indented at least as much as the block's first line, and the
  column-0 lines silently terminated the block, producing a malformed
  workflow file that GitHub Actions rejected at load time with no
  visible error. Fix: replace the heredoc with a properly-indented
  PowerShell array joined by newline. Documented in
  [`docs/RELEASE-PROCESS.md`](docs/RELEASE-PROCESS.md) so it isn't
  re-discovered the hard way.
